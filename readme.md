Keith's Linux presentation.
---------------------------
Getting started with Linux
---------------------------


Lesson Objectives:
1. Define Linux
2. Why you should use it.
3. How to make the switch to Linux.


What is Linux?
--------------
"Linux" is a blanket term for any operating system that runs off of the Linux kernel.  The kernel itself was originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and it is the component of the computer that takes requests from the software and translates it into processing information for other parts of the computer such as the CPU, the memory and any devices.

What sets it apart from other operating systems is that it is a free and open-source project.  Anyone may contribute a change or "patch" to the project and once it has been approved, it is included in the next update or release of the software.  You're already familiar with this method of development otherwise known as "Git".

This has lead to the development of close to 300active versions of Linux (commonly known as "distros").  These can range from server/supercomputer software to desktop and laptops, to mobile and embedded devices.  The distros themselves are maintained by either independent communities as well or coporate sponsors such as Red Hat (fedora), Canonical (Ubuntu) and Google(Android).  If you're using an Android device, you're using Linux already.


So what are the advantages of using this free software?
-------------------------------------------------------
    1. It's free.
    2. You can install it on pretty much any computer and even share it with your friends if you'd like no license or key required.
    3.  It is well maintained and rarely crashes.  No blue screen of death here.
    4.  It's pretty damn secure. Even with the Shellshock outbreak last year, it still has a rather impressive track record over the past 20+ years.  There are also several distros that have a security focus in mind.
    6.  Apps are incredibly easy to install.  Several distros have their own package or application managers that will go get it for you like Ubuntu's Unity  you can install most of your software directly from the command line.  It's pretty baller when you type in one command see everything load for you.
    5. Linux is damn fast.  There's rarely any bloatware in there and users can easily get rid of what they don't need in order to make it faster. Because of it's light weight, you can use it to breathe life into old computers.



 How can I start using Linux?
 ----------------------------
 1. My firs recommendation is to start slowly.  You can begin by swtiching out your apps for open-source alternatives.  Some great open-source alternatives are VLC media player, GIMP or LibreOffice.  Once you get comfortable enough with those, you can:

 2. Download a version of Linux via direct download or torrent and burn to a cd or usb stick using a program like Mac Linux USB(https://sevenbits.github.io/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/).  All you have to do on startup is hold the option key and then use the startup manager.  After that, just follow the step and take it for a test drive.

 3. If you go ahead and deicde that you are comfortable with that, you can always partition your hard drive to dual boot both OS-X and your Linux Distro. There are two great articles on HowToGeek (http://www.howtogeek.com/187410/how-to-install-and-dual-boot-linux-on-a-mac/) and Lifehacker(http://lifehacker.com/5934942/how-to-dual-boot-linux-on-your-mac-and-take-back-your-powerhouse-apple-hardware) that walk you through the steps.

 4. Finally, once you are comfortable, go all in and install directly.  There's another great walkthrough on MacLife (http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/install_linux_your_mac) on how to do this.

 Hold on a second Keith!  Didn't you say that there were almost 300 distros? Which one should I use?
 ---------------------------------------------------
 I agree, it's hard to figure out which ones are the best for your needs.  Most of them are for hardcore programs, but there are a few "Linux for people" distros that you could check out and run right out of the box:

 1. Ubuntu:  Probably the #1 distro overall and it has elements that both Windows and Mac users can both appreciate.
 2. Mint: The #1 contender for distro supremacy.  It's usually Mint or Ubuntu at the top of the DistroWatch top ten list and it operates a lot like Windows.  It just doesn't crash as much.
 3. Elementary OS: The new kid on the block.  It's only been around 2 years, but has gained quite a following.  It operates very much like a Mac would.
